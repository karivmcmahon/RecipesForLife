The student notes that the scripts could have more meaningful names than WebForms. However  the scripts were originally created as WebForms and changing file names in ASP.net may have led to functional issues. Given time constraints and the risk of affecting functionality a decision was taken not to rename at this point. The student  plans to address this issue in the future.

The .aspx files are the pages which the application accesses with a http post request with a json attached. These pages are blank aspx pages, the code for the scripts are in the .aspx.cs files which will start on page load.
