The student notes that the scripts could have more meaningful names than WebForms. However  the scripts were originally created as WebForms and changing file names in ASP.net may have led to functional issues. Given time constraints and the risk of affecting functionality a decision was taken not to rename at this point. The student  plans to address this issue in the future.
