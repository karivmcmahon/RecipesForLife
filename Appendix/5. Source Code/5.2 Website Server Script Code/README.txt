The student notes that the scripts should have more meaningful names than WebForms but they were orginally created as WebForms and changing file names in ASP.net once created can cause issues. The student wanted to change the file names before submission but was concerned it may cause too many issues and did not want to take the risk close to submission. The student does plan on changing these to more meaningful names after the submission when time constraints are less strict.
